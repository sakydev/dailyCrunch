# What is dailyCrunch?
A simple BASH file that can speedup daily tasks for developer / sysadmin.

# Why dailyCrunch?
The sole reason for creation of this project is my utter hatred toward repitiive tasks :P

There are a lot of tasks that I encounter multiple times a day so every time I have to do something twice, I add it to this file and I don't have to perform task next time. 

Even though I created it for myself, I'm pretty sure there are parts of it that can be useful for other developers too. I'll keep adding more commands in future.

# Usage
## svnupdate
Update SVN across unlimited servers

```
dailyCrunch svnupdate serverCreds.txt
```
**serverCreds.txt Format**
Unlimited servers, one server per line.
